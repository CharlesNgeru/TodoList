## Todo List
#Basic TodoList Web Application

## Motivation
I made this project while I was learning jQuery and I wanted to use the library to reduce the amount of VanillaJS needed, and I succeeded in doing so, the web-application is awesome and the code is as "dry" as I could make it.

## Tech/framework used
Ex. - jQuery, HTML, CSS, JS and Font Awesome web-application pack.


<b>Built with</b>
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.com)

## Features
The Application can be used for offline purposes since the libraries are sited offline

## Installation
Just open/run the index.html in your browser by double clicking it or right-clicking then choose open with your browser. It is as easy as that!!

## How to use?
You can add todos add at the input box with the placeholder "Add New Todo", type what you'd like to add then press Enter.

You can cross of a completed todo with a strikethrough by pressing on the text.

You can delete a todo by moving the mouse to the left border where a delete button(red trash can) will appear just press to delete an entry.

The upper right addition sign has a hamburger effect that toggles the input box either to display or hide it.
